📝 Instructions
Let's simulate a traffic light.

The light has to glow when clicked.

The whole purpose of the component is displaying a traffic light with red, yellow and green lights.
When any light is clicked (selected) it has to glow, but the other lights have to stop glowing.
The component must have a hooked state variable that tracks the color:
const [ color, setColor] = useState("red");
Use the setColor function to change the color and the component will automatically re-render (because it's hooked with useState).

Use the ReactDOM.render to render the component into the DOM like this

ReactDOM.render(<TrafficLight />, document.querySelector('#app'));
